# Systems-Programming

Includes key features like:

- Memory management: Implementing concepts like paging, segmentation, and virtual memory.
- Process management: Creating, scheduling, and managing processes.
- File systems: Implementing file systems, managing files and directories.
- Inter-process communication: Implementing communication between processes using methods like pipes, message queues, shared memory, etc.
- Device management: Writing device drivers, managing I/O devices.

1. main.c: This is a C source file.

2. Demand_Paging: This directory contains a project related to demand paging, a method of managing computer memory in operating systems. The README.md file in this directory should provide more details.

3. File_System: This directory contains two subdirectories, iNode_Implementation and LinkedList_Implementation, which likely contain implementations of a file system using iNodes and linked lists respectively.

4. Job_Scheduler: This directory contains a project related to CPU scheduling, a process by which a computer system determines which process should access the CPU. The README.md and Documentation.md files in this directory should provide more details.

5. LKM: This directory likely contains a project related to Loadable Kernel Modules (LKM), which are object files that contain code to extend the running kernel of an operating system.

6. SHM_Shell: This directory likely contains a project related to shared memory and shell programming. The README.md and Documentation.md files in this directory should provide more details.
